# how it works
<br />I enter data onto a telegram bot
<br />Telegram bot sends this data into 2 separate cells on a google sheet (via cloud script)
<br />A formula on google sheet searches for the last entry of a quantity and copies the corresponding data in the next column
<br />This data is then linked and copied onto another spreadsheet
<br />My website automatically updates every 60 seconds with the latest entry submitted/copied from this sheet
<br />This spreadsheet is linked to my website written in HTML and hosted on GitHub pages
