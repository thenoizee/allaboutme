# how it works
I enter data onto a telegram bot
Telegram bot sends this data into 2 separate cells on a google sheet (via cloud script)
A formula on google sheet searches for the last entry of a quantity and copies the corresponding data in the next column
This data is then linked and copied onto another spreadsheet
My website automatically updates every 60 seconds with the latest entry submitted/copied from this sheet
This spreadsheet is linked to my website written in HTML and hosted on GitHub pages
